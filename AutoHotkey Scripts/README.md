This contains any AutoHotKey scripts I write.

For those who don't know, AutoHotKey allows a user to make code in scripts,
which are then transformed into executables and run on a computer. The scripts
allow you to code a command or set of commands to be run when a certain keyboard
shortcut (a hotkey) is executed.

Right now, my scripts include:
-CalcShortcut, which takes you to the calculator app with Ctrl-Alt-C
